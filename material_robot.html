			The Material Handling Robot is my Capstone Project under the guidance of Prof. Vijay Desai and will be completed on May 2019. Our motivation is to develop a material handling mobile robot that can autonomously relocate objects by using a universal gripper instead of the conventional wrists. We are also motivated to study the performance of different exploration algorithms to navigate in the workspace and locate the objects.

		 			My Contributions Highlights:
		 			<br>
		 		<br>
		 		<ul>
		 			<li>Designed and assembled the pneumatic system to control the universal gripper</li>
		 			<li>Designed the circuit to control the robot and gripper</li>
		 			<li>Programmed the forward and inverse kinematic equation solver for the robot for accurate control</li>
		 			<li>Led the team of 5 members to implement and test different sub-sections of overall system which includes the computer program, electrical circuitry and mechanical assembly</li>
		 		</ul>

	 		The first stage of the project was map generation using Gmapping on the Gazebo platform with a model of Kobuki
			TurtleBot. We had created a simple maze like arena and the robot was a part of it. The map generated through SLAM was decently similar to the
			actual arena.

	 		In the second stage of the project, the team built a
			physical robot with an ultrasonic sensor and a
			camera. Each landmark had a unique colour.
			The ultrasonic sensor measure the distance
			between the robot and a landmark and the
			camera identified that landmark. The distance measured from the ultrasonic sensors and the angle from the servo motor were used as inputs to the GraphSLAM function.
