			Our motivation to take up this project is to aid underwater computer vision by fabricating a robust fish robot with a camera that can capture underwater environments. This project is a collaboration with IEEE NITK under the guidance of Prof. Guruprasad KR and will be presented in the NITK Project Expo 2019.

			We want to develop a fish robot using the concepts of soft-robotics and visual servoing to rendevouz with underwater targets. The fish will be actuated by 2 servo motors, sense the environment with an IMU sensor and a camera and be controlled by a Raspberry Pi.

		 			My Contributions Highlights:
		 			<br>
		 		<br>
		 		<ul>
		 			<li>Designed the system architecture and the CAD model for the fish </li>
		 			<li>Developped the dynamic equations of the mechanical motion</li>
		 			<li>Leading a team of 5 members to implement and test different sub-sections of overall system which includes the computer program, electrical circuitry and mechanical assembly</li>
		 		</ul>

	 		The first stage of the project was map generation using Gmapping on the Gazebo platform with a model of Kobuki
			TurtleBot. We had created a simple maze like arena and the robot was a part of it. The map generated through SLAM was decently similar to the
			actual arena.

	<!-- 	  <div class='info'>
	 		In the second stage of the project, the team built a
			physical robot with an ultrasonic sensor and a
			camera. Each landmark had a unique colour.
			The ultrasonic sensor measure the distance
			between the robot and a landmark and the
			camera identified that landmark. The distance measured from the ultrasonic sensors and the angle from the servo motor were used as inputs to the GraphSLAM function.
