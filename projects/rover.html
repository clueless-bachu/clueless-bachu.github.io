			Planetary Rovers are vehicles for interplanetary missions. Due to rough terrain in Mars and our moon, these vehicles were developed to navigate in these environments without damaging the internal electronics and machinery. Inspired from the Martian Rover Curiosity, we designed and fabricated our own rover. It can go over obstacles a third of its height with the help of the Rocker-Bogie Mechanism.
